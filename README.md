# Merkle tree in Python for working with Solidity

Currently work-in-progress

scripts/test_mtree.py contains Merkle tree class and basic usage (will change in the future)

Using:
    ganache-cli (Node.js)
    brownie (Python)

Problems to solve:
- root hash doesn't match one in the contract
- ~~deploy and test transactions with Merkle tree on local testnet~~
- deploy and test on Rinkeby
- test on already deployed contracts
