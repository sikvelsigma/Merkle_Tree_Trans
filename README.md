# Merkle tree in Python for working with Solidity

Currently work-in-progress

scripts/test_mtree.py contains Merkle tree class and basic usage (will change in the future)

Problems to solve:
- root hash doesn't match one in the contract
- deploy and test transactions with Merkle tree on local testnet
- deploy and test on testnet
- test on already deployed contracts
